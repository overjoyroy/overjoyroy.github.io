Hi, Iâ€™m Joy. I hold a PhD in Biomedical Informatics from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. My career spans software engineering in the telecommunications sector, research roles at nonprofits and hospitals, and data science in clinical settings. My work focuses on the intersection of data science and software engineering, with an emphasis on clinical applications, computer-aided detection, and predictive modeling.

I am currently at Mayo Clinic, where I design and implement generative AI solutions to address open challenges in medicine and clinical practice. I am passionate about advancing the fields of machine learning, data science, and healthcare.
